# CrewAI Project

This repository contains an intelligent automation system built using CrewAI, a powerful framework for orchestrating role-based autonomous AI agents. The system enables collaborative problem-solving through a crew of specialized AI agents working together to accomplish complex tasks.

## Features

- Role-based AI agents with specialized capabilities
- Dynamic task delegation and coordination
- Flexible agent communication patterns
- Customizable agent behaviors and expertise
- Scalable multi-agent workflows

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CrewAI.git
cd CrewAI
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

## Usage

Basic example of creating and running a crew:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create agents
researcher = Agent(
    role='Researcher',
    goal='Conduct thorough research on the given topic',
    backstory='You are an expert researcher with vast knowledge'
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Writer',
    goal='Create comprehensive and engaging content',
    backstory='You are a skilled writer with expertise in technical documentation'
)

# Create tasks
research_task = Task(
    description='Research the latest developments in AI',
    agent=researcher
)

writing_task = Task(
    description='Write a detailed report based on the research',
    agent=writer
)

# Create and run the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task]
)

result = crew.kickoff()
```
